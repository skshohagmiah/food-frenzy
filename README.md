This is a food ordering app build with nextjs, nextauth and mongoose. this app has some big features like food ordering functionality and a dashboard that is only accessible for admin users. in dashboard admin can create new menu, new category and new restaurant. and admin can see and delete all users. I could not intregrate payment sysment because of stripe is not available in bangledesh.
